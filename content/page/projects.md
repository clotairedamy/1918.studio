#### epsilon

* We are currently working on an advanced sports scheduling system that will solve some of the hardest problems organisers and players are faced with: hundreds of teams, thousands of matches, unplanned events such as bad weather or unexpectedly long matches – what used to take weeks to do by hand can now be done in minutes. 
*  Our system can automatically generate the best schedule for all parties involved – players and officials alike – while allowing for fine-grained manual control where required.
* Other features will include: real-time rescheduling – in case of unplanned events; high-level tournament description – allows you to work with concepts such as round-robin pools or elimination brackets instead of individual matches; automatic seeding with adjustable parameters; time preference system – manually provide hints to the automatic scheduler as to when to schedule specific matches.
